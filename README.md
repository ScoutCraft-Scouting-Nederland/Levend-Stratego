# Levend Stratego
Levend Stratego is a gamemode where two teams have to search for a flag. They can hinder eachother by tagging, where a rank will decided who will win the fight.

## The gameplay
Every team starts in their own base, where one player of the team gets the flag. This player has the task to hide the flag in there playing area.

If both teams placed the flag or the time is over, the game starts. All players get a rank and go into the arena. There the goal is searching for the flag of the opponent and bringing that flag into your own base.

Players can tag eachother to make the search for the flag more difficult or even to take the flag back. This is where the ranks come in to play. The following ranks are in the game, and the amount of ranks per deck and number of decks are configurable. Before the start of the game, the cards are shuffled.:
- spy (Can kill the marshall. Is killed by everyone, except the marshall.)
- scout (Can run extra fast.)
- miner (Can defeat the bomb.)
- sergeant
- lieutenant
- captain
- major
- colonel
- general
- marshall (Is strongest, but is killed when attacking a bomb, or when killed by a spy.)
- bomb (Kills everyone, except the miner, but cannot attack anyone.)

Where two ranks are the same, nothing will happen.

When a player is killed, he will spawn back into the base of his team. If there are still cards available, the player will get a choose of maximal 3 cards and can choose one.

When a player finds the flag of the enemy, the player can pick the flag up and try to take it to his base to place it there. When he picks the flag up, he becomes extra visible for the other team. When an enemy tags him, and has a better rank. The enemy will take his own flag back. He then has a limited amount of time to rehide his flag. If he is too late, the flag will be placed at his feed.

A player with a flag of the enemy can give the flag to teammates by click on them.
